SYNOPSIS
               sub method() {
                   my ($self, $c) = @_;
                   my $data = $c‐>model(’Git’)‐>list();

DESCRIPTION
       A model to allow access to a Git repository.

CONFIG
       The following configuration options are available:

       directory

       Returns the path to the Git repository. At the moment, only local
       access (to a repository on a local filesystem) is supported.

       This value comes from the config key ’directory’.

       branch

       This is the default branch to use when no branch is specified. By
       default, this will be "master".

METHODS
           * new() Constructor for the model. The directory where the reposi‐
                   tory is located must be defined via the configuration for
                   the package.

           * branch_sha1()
                   Return the SHA1 of the current branch. Default branch is
                   master.

           * list($path)
                   List the objects under VC at $path or at the tree‐level if
                   no path specified.  Returns an arrayref containing Cata‐
                   lyst::Model::Git::Object objects, representing the contents
                   for the required revision.
